# ID to UID

This Proof-Of-Concept tests an ID to UID mapper to mitigate the security issue
of working with sequential IDs, without adding a new index to retrieve elements
from the database and benefit from the optimized index on sequential columns.

The goal is to provide a bijection to convert an ID to a string looking like a
pseudo-generated alphanumeric string (the UID), and convert back to the
original ID, in the least amount of time possible.

### Blowfish encryption

In kotlin, columns of type BIGINT are translated to instances of Long, which
are represented using 8 bytes (64bits).

Blowfish is the preferred cypher algorithm to use in this scenario for the
following reasons:
 * Uses a 64bits block
 * Has the best performances for this class of encryption

Average cipher/decipher time is less than 1Âµs on my computer
